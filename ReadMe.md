## Thought process

* Use a REST API instead of a html site directly, this way we can use this API in mobile apps, 3 party integrations and a HTML site
* Make the core functionallity inside the Stratsys.Core project. This way we can change the delivery method in the future from HTTP to lets say RPC.
